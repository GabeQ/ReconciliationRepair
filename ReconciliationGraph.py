# This file contains function for building the cycle checking graph, 
# cycleCheckingGraph, which is in the form of a dictionary. This dictionary 
# has keys that are nodes and values that are a list of all the children. The 
# cycleCheckingGraph represents edges between nodes that show the temporal 
# relationship between the host tree and the parasite Tree. The main function
# in this file is buildReconstruction and the rest of the functions are 
# helper function that are used by buildReconstruction

# This cycle checking graph is known in the paper as a temporal feasability 
# graph
