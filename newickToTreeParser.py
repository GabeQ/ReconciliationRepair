# This files converts all .newick files in the real-100taxa folder into
# corresponding .tree files (that are later used as Jane's inputs) 
# in the treeFiles folder.
#
# Run with
#   python newickToTreeParser.py
#
#
# A tree file must consist of a series of blocks: 
# HOSTTREE, HOSTNAMES, PARASITETREE, PARASITENAMES, PHI, HOSTNAMES, 
# and optionally HOSTRANKS, PARASITERANKS, HOSTREGIONS and REGIONCOSTS, 
# in that order.

# HOSTTREE and PARASITETREE should consist of a series of entries, 
# one line for each node of each tree, of the form: 
# node	child1	child2
# for internal nodes, or 
# node	null	null
# for tips. Every node here needs to be represented by a number.

# HOSTNAMES and PARASITENAMES should be a series of lines listing the parasite/host's number, 
# a tab, then a human-readable name for the host/parasite.

# PHI should be a series of lines listing a host number, a tab, and then a list of parasite 
# tips that infect that particular host. A host may appear at the start of multiple lines. 
# Only the tips of the host and parasite tree should be used in this section (no internal 
# node numbers should appear).
